### File structure

File structure that incorporates the idea of having separate files for different request handlers and better organization:

```
server/
  src/
    index.ts                        # Entry point for the server
    lsp/
      bitloopsServer.ts             # Bitloops language server implementation
      handlers/
        completionHandler.ts        # Completion request handler
        hoverHandler.ts             # Hover request handler
        // Other request handlers...
      models/
        // Language-specific models, interfaces, or types
    utils/
      // Utility functions or helper modules
  package.json                       # Package dependencies and scripts
  tsconfig.json                      # TypeScript compiler configuration for server
```

Explanation of the structure:

- src/index.ts: The entry point for the server application.
- src/lsp/server.ts: This file contains the implementation of the Bitloops language server. It can handle various LSP features and delegate specific request handling to separate handler modules.
- src/lsp/client.ts: This file contains the implementation of the LSP Client, used to push results generated by the server, to the user's interface.
- src/lsp/handlers/: This directory now contains individual files for different request handlers. For example, completionHandler.ts handles completion requests, hoverHandler.ts handles hover requests, and so on. You can create additional files for other request handlers as needed.
- src/lsp/models/: This directory still holds language-specific models, interfaces, or types that are used by the LSP server and request handlers.
- src/utils/: This directory remains for utility functions or helper modules.
